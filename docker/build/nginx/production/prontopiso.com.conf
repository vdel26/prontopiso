# This http -> https redirection is expected to work in an environment
# where a load proxy/balancer terminates the HTTPS connection and forwards it
# to origin servers, defined down. We don't have HTTPS listeners because
# the proxy/balancer is serving them. This is why we have to inspect the
# 'x-forwarded-proto' header coming from the proxy/balancer to know if the
# originating request was HTTP oe HTTPS
